Marx takes a set of CSV files in a directory and creates a union (geddit?) of their contents.

By default it will slurp up all csv files in the current working directory and save the output in the `./output` directory with a filename based on the current timestamp. You can overwrite these defaults with flags if you like:

```
./marx --input . --output ./output/Aug_27-14_04_05_19.csv
```
